# Guest Book - WDI Second Project

For my second project at General Assembly, I created an app where wedding guests can share stories and content about the wedding and the couple to be married. 

The couple will have this webpage to look back on and the guests will be able to get to know each other a little pre-wedding by sharing stories over their common interest - the couple. 

I wanted to make it fun, so as well as posting well wishes for the couple, guests can also create polls and share funny stories and ideas for the couples future. 

Project Overview
==================================

Welcome to Guest Book

Get your guests excited about your wedding by sharing stories about the happy couple

1. Create a user account to be part of the fun!
2. You can then either create a new guestbook or rsvp to an existing one by searching through the guest books directory, selecting your chosen wedding and entering the secret RSVP code which you will have been given by the couple or the book creater
3. Add questions that all that wedding's guests can answer about that couple or answer existing questions

Easy as that!

To Use The App
-----------
All guest books have a secret RSVP code which only the creater of the guest book can see.  This code would need to be given to guests separately.

Example codes are as follows:

* Meghan & Jake - 5632
* Sunshine & Harrison - 9451
* Lucy & Heather - 9526
* Shawn & Ameera - 7829
* Ben & Alfie - 5634

Problems?
---------

1. At first I found the controllers complicated to get my head around - I have learnt a lot about this from this project and now am feeling much more confident
2. Time. I hadn't appreciated how ambitious my idea was with models referenced within models. This took a lot of time to work out the logic for and took away time to develop some of the front end effects that I would have liked to add.


Features to Add
----------------

1. Search bar on Guest Book index page to find your couple
2. Ability to edit questions and comments
3. Add more interesting ways to display comments. For example questions like - where should we honeymoon would be shown on google maps, and polls like who would win in a fight would show in a graph.
